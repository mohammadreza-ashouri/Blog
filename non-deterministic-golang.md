# The Challenge of Go's Map Iteration in the Cosmos SDK Blockchain: A Dive into Determinism
## Author, Dr. Mo Ashouri, https://ashoury.net

The Go programming language, commonly referred to as Golang, is celebrated for its concurrency capabilities, efficiency, and simplicity. 
However, like all languages, Go has its idiosyncrasies. One such peculiarity that has raised eyebrows, especially in deterministic systems like blockchain, is the non-deterministic iteration behavior of its native map data structure.



## Background: The Pillar of Determinism in Blockchain

In a blockchain, determinism stands as a non-negotiable element. Every node in a decentralized network must process transactions identically, ensuring they reach the same state. This uniformity maintains consensus across the entire network.

However, non-deterministic behaviors, where outcomes are unpredictable or varied, can spell disaster in this environment:

- **Consensus Failure:** Nodes with differing states can cause the network to splinter, leading to forks.
- **Double Spending:** Indeterminacy can be exploited, allowing actors to spend the same funds multiple times.
- **Contract Vulnerabilities:** Smart contracts relying on a specific order can malfunction, leading to unintended behaviors.

Given these potential pitfalls, the language and tools used in developing blockchain solutions become paramount.

## Golang & Cosmos SDK: A Powerful Duo

The Cosmos SDK is a powerhouse for creating interoperable, customizable, and scalable blockchains. At its core, it leverages Go (Golang), renowned for its simplicity and efficiency. However, with Go's many strengths come certain quirks, one being its behavior with map iterations.

In Go, iterating over maps does not guarantee a consistent order. For many applications, this poses no issue. But within the rigid deterministic world of blockchain, such variability can introduce severe challenges.

### A Simple Example

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    m := map[string]int{
        "one":   1,
        "two":   2,
        "three": 3,
    }

    for key, value := range m {
        fmt.Println(key, value)
    }
}
```

This Go program, when run multiple times, might yield differing key-value pair orders:

```go
Run 1:
one 1
three 3
two 2

Run 2:
two 2
one 1
three 3
```

Such unpredictable orders can cause the aforementioned issues when applied in a blockchain project.

## Implications for Blockchain
In the domain of blockchain, determinism is of utmost importance. For a blockchain network to maintain consensus, it's crucial that all nodes process transactions in the exact same sequence, leading to an identical state. The non-deterministic behavior of Go's map iteration poses a risk, as it can introduce subtle inconsistencies between nodes, potentially leading to consensus failures.

### A few potential risks include:

- Consensus Failure: As mentioned, nodes may derive different states due to varying order of map iteration, resulting in a split or "fork" in the blockchain.
- Smart Contract Vulnerabilities: Contracts, especially those that involve token distribution or voting mechanisms, may malfunction if they rely on specific map iteration order.
- Transaction Inconsistencies: Differences in transaction ordering across nodes can cause discrepancies in the blockchain state.

### Other Non-deterministic Behaviors
While map iteration stands out, it's worth noting that Go has other potential sources of non-determinism. For instance:

- Goroutines: The scheduling of goroutines is not deterministic. If not handled carefully, concurrent execution can introduce race conditions, another source of non-determinism.
- Time-dependent operations: Functions that depend on the current time, like time.Now(), can produce different results across nodes.

## Solutions for the developers


The non-deterministic behavior of Go's map iteration presents challenges, but they are by no means insurmountable. Cosmos SDK developers have several strategies at their disposal to ensure determinism, and by extension, maintain the integrity of the blockchain systems they build. Below are expanded solutions with more detailed explanations:

### 1. Avoid Native Go Maps for Critical Logic
- **Description**: In contexts where the sequence of data is paramount, relying on Go's native map can introduce unwanted variability. The iteration order of a map isn't fixed and can differ across program runs.
- **Recommendation**: Instead of the native map, utilize slices or linked lists, which maintain the order of insertion. These data structures provide predictability, making them more suited for deterministic systems like blockchain. When order is a non-issue, maps remain a powerful tool for O(1) average time complexity lookups.

### 2. Embrace Deterministic Data Structures
- **Description**: Recognizing the need for determinism in blockchain applications, the Cosmos SDK comes equipped with tools tailored for this very purpose.
- **Recommendation**: Make use of structures like the `KVStore` provided by Cosmos SDK. The `KVStore` is a key-value store that guarantees deterministic behavior, thereby eliminating the concerns associated with non-deterministic map iterations. By leaning into these purpose-built structures, developers can harness the power of Go while ensuring their blockchain applications remain consistent across all nodes<sup>1</sup>.

### 3. Rigorous Testing
- **Description**: The complex nature of blockchain applications, combined with the intricacies of the Go language, means that unforeseen behaviors might emerge in edge cases or uncommon scenarios.
- **Recommendation**: Implement a robust testing regimen. Continual and comprehensive testing of smart contract logic, especially in varied and extreme scenarios, is essential. Unit tests, integration tests, and stress tests can help developers identify and rectify potential non-deterministic behaviors before they manifest in a live environment. Modern testing tools and frameworks for Go can simulate different conditions and sequences to ensure the desired determinism.

By incorporating these solutions into their development workflow, Cosmos SDK developers can effectively navigate the challenges posed by Go's non-deterministic behaviors, ensuring the creation of robust and reliable blockchain systems.


## Conclusion

When building with the Cosmos SDK using Go, understanding the specifics of Go's data structures becomes essential. One such nuance is the behavior of Go maps, which can be unpredictable. For blockchain applications where every detail matters, this unpredictability can lead to larger issues.

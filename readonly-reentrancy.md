# Read-Only Reentrancy Vulnerability in the EVM

Understanding reentrancy vulnerabilities in smart contracts, especially the subtle read-only reentrancy vulnerability in the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), is essential for secure development.

## Reentrancy Vulnerability

A typical reentrancy attack happens when a contract calls an external contract and allows further interaction with the calling contract before its state is properly updated. An attacker can exploit this to repeatedly call the vulnerable contract and drain funds or manipulate its state.

### Example

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.4.26;

contract Vulnerable {
    mapping(address => uint) public balances;

    function withdraw(uint amount) public {
        require(balances[msg.sender] >= amount);
        
        msg.sender.call.value(amount)("");

        balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
    }
}


In this code, the transfer of Ether occurs before updating the balance, allowing a malicious contract to repeatedly withdraw Ether, ignoring the balance check.

## Read-Only Reentrancy Vulnerability
The read-only reentrancy vulnerability is a subtler form of reentrancy that doesn't change the state of the vulnerable contract but can still cause harm by manipulating its reads and computations.

This vulnerability occurs when a contract calls another contract (e.g., via a view or pure function) and relies on that contract's result without considering that the called contract might also interact with the original one in a reentrant manner.

### Example:

```
pragma solidity ^0.4.26;

contract Victim {
    uint256 public value;

    constructor(uint256 initialValue) {
        value = initialValue;
    }

    function getValueViaCaller(address caller) public view returns (uint256) {
        return caller.delegatecall(bytes4(keccak256("getValue()")));
    }
}

contract Attacker {
    Victim victim;

    constructor(address victimAddress) {
        victim = Victim(victimAddress);
    }

    function getValue() public view returns (uint256) {
        victim.value = 0; // Manipulate the value
        return victim.value;
    }

    function attack() public {
        victim.getValueViaCaller(this);
    }
}
```


In this code, the Victim contract relies on a call to another contract to get its value. If that contract is an Attacker contract, it can manipulate the value before returning it.

### Mitigation
Mitigating these issues often involves:

- Careful design and understanding of contract interactions.
- Employing proper access controls.
- Using tools like formal verification or thorough code review.

#Conclusion
Reentrancy vulnerabilities, especially read-only reentrancy, are significant security risks in the EVM. Proper understanding and careful coding practices are required to prevent potential exploits. Developers should be aware of these vulnerabilities and use best practices to develop secure smart contracts.
